# Dandy Encounter

You're a Dungeon Master (DM), and you're guiding a band of misfits through a campaign, when suddenly they're attacked! It's time for an encounter, but it's going to take precious time to look up monster statistics, roll for initiative and determine turn order. 

...Once that's done, you still have to manually tabulate each monster's health, let alone consult each monster's special abilities and information as needed. Playing  a game is about the playing, not accounting!

Dandy will alleviate all your woes - You can create encounters on the fly, allowing you to instantly access every monster in D&D and add them to an encounter. Control hit points and initiative from one simle interface, and focus on your game, not your spreadsheets.
